## The Problem

NodeJS has come a long way since its inception, and it has become the de facto standard for building modern web applications. However, the NodeJS ecosystem is vast and fragmented, and it can be challenging to find the right tools and packages for your project. The process of setting up a new project can be time-consuming and tedious, and it often requires a steep learning curve. Furthermore, the NodeJS community is constantly evolving, and it can be difficult to keep up with the latest trends and best practices.

The builder ecosystem is as vibrany as ever. Entire companies have been built around the idea of making it easier to build and maintain web applications. This is such a thriving space that it is difficult to keep up with the latest trends and best practices.

By creating a defacto standard around the most promising tools and packages, we can make it easier for developers to get started with NodeJS and build full stack modern web applications with all the moving parts including:

- Database
- Queueing
- Caching
- Email
- Boilerplate

We will focus on the best of the free solutions so that you can get up and running without having to pay for a bunch of services and hosting.
